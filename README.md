<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->



 # Problem Statement:

<p>Many users are facing problems with Discord due to poor management of files and data, leading to a confusing and cluttered experience. This can make it difficult for users to find the information they need and can negatively impact their overall user experience.</p>

# Solution:

<p>To address this issue, we have developed a bot and website that work together to streamline the management of data and files in Discord. The bot will monitor Discord channels for relevant information and automatically update the website with the latest information. This will help ensure that all information is up-to-date and easily accessible to users. Additionally, the website will provide a user-friendly interface for users to navigate and find the information they need. Overall, this solution aims to improve the user experience on Discord by simplifying the management of data and files.</p>
